# Snake Using Perlin Noise

Welcome to this fun site. This site displays the use of perlin noise function in a visual form. Perlin noise function is a randomization function with a specific pattern. Each value is related to previous value i.e. present value is slightly larger or smaller than previous value this gives the illusion of controlled pattern.
